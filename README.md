## My process

### Built with ❗️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive images
- Responsive Website

### What I learned ❗️

Using "picture" tag, browser know what image should to load depending on viewport width 😀
```html

```

I decide to create a custom arrow for tab headers Instead to use a svg. But I was wondering is that very complicated? Off Course a easy way is to use svg as a background image
```css

```

And this part is not clearly Understand For me. Why in if condition don't use an equal operator? It supposes if activeTab is true then run a code, but why activeTab Should be "true"? 
```js

```

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn a JavaScript. Currently, I'm working on Course from Udemy. App Brewery Web Developer Bootcamp. And to do practice, practice and practice one more 😉
